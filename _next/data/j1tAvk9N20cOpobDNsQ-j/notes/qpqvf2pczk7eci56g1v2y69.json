As a Principal Engineer at Sourcepoint Technologies, a privacy-tech company in NYC, I've spent years developing high-performing distributed systems leveraged by global enterprises like CNN, IBM, Byte-Dance, A&#x26;E Networks, BBC, WSJ, and Sky Group. I lead the core-services team at Sourcepoint, and we are responsible for developing and maintaining our microservices that receive up to 300,000 requests per second. Our services are leveraged by some of the biggest enterprises and publishers worldwide to monetize their online experience through ad revenue. This experience has given me valuable insights into software architecture, system design, distributed systems, distributed logging, distributed metrics, high-scale monitoring, and engineering leadership—skills I now seek to complement with formal education in machine learning and artificial intelligence through UPenn's MS-AI program.</p>\n<h3 id=\"professional-background-and-transition-to-ai\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#professional-background-and-transition-to-ai\"></a>Professional Background and Transition to AI</h3>\n<p>My interest in machine learning began organically through my work. As technology evolved, I noticed a shift in how we could approach software problems. In early 2023, I began systematically studying machine learning, starting with Andrew Ng's courses on Coursera to establish a foundation in linear and logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble methods. I supplemented this with statistical knowledge from OpenStax Statistics (Rice University) and deepened my understanding by studying seminal papers like \"Attention is All You Need,\" learning about transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and backpropagation through YouTube videos and free courses.</p>\n<p>This self-directed education enabled me to conceptualize and lead Sourcepoint's first AI/ML project—leveraging foundation models to generate consent messages (our proprietary format for representing HTML, CSS, and JS). The project aims to dramatically reduce setup time for our clients from days to minutes. Working on this initiative required me to develop skills in prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject relevant context into foundation models.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-ai-now\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-ai-now\"></a>Why AI Now?</h3>\n<p>While these advancements in AI have enabled software engineers like me to build intelligent applications without developing the models ourselves, this very democratization has revealed limitations in my knowledge. The more I work with these models, the more I recognize the value of understanding their fundamental architecture and training methodologies rather than treating them as managed black boxes through the OpenAI API or Amazon Bedrock.</p>\n<p>I find myself increasingly constrained by not having the expertise to build or fine-tune models that could better serve specific use cases. There's a substantial difference between being an AI engineer who implements existing models versus being a machine learning engineer who understands the mathematical foundations and can create tailored solutions. This realization is the primary motivation for my pursuit of further education.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-upenns-ms-ai-program\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-upenns-ms-ai-program\"></a>Why UPenn's MS-AI Program?</h3>\n<p>After researching programs at Georgia Tech, UT Austin, and UIUC, UPenn's curriculum stands out for its strong foundation in core ML/AI concepts. Courses like Principles of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and GPU Computing for Machine Learning Systems align perfectly with my goal of building a comprehensive theoretical foundation that I can immediately apply in industry to build modern distributed ML systems.</p>\n<p>Given my full-time leadership responsibilities at Sourcepoint, the part-time online format is ideal. I intend to leverage this degree to facilitate a seamless transition from infrastructure engineering to MLOps, combining my production engineering experience with cutting-edge AI knowledge to build more sophisticated, efficient systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-vision\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#future-vision\"></a>Future Vision</h3>\n<p>With the MS-AI degree from UPenn, I aim to bridge the gap between traditional software engineering and modern AI systems at Sourcepoint. My immediate goal is to enhance our current AI initiatives by implementing more sophisticated, custom-trained models rather than relying solely on third-party APIs. Long-term, I envision building AI systems that can autonomously generate and optimize consent experiences based on user behavior data and regulatory requirements, potentially revolutionizing how privacy technology functions in the digital ecosystem.</p>\n<p>At Sourcepoint, we are also looking to build models to detect privacy compliance issues for our clients across their various applications. These models would analyze user interfaces, data flows, and backend systems to identify potential violations of regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and emerging privacy laws. By leveraging computer vision and NLP techniques, we could automatically scan websites and applications to detect missing consent notices, improper data collection practices, or unauthorized data sharing. This initiative would transform how companies approach privacy compliance, shifting from reactive manual audits to proactive, continuous monitoring. With the knowledge gained from UPenn's MS-AI program, particularly courses on computer vision and NLP, I would be equipped to lead the development of these specialized models that understand the nuanced requirements of global privacy regulations. This project represents a significant opportunity to apply AI for regulatory technology (\"RegTech\") solutions that could become an industry standard for privacy compliance verification.</p>\n<p>My background in software engineering provides me with the operational knowledge to deploy AI systems at scale, while the MS-AI program will give me the theoretical foundation to build these systems from first principles. This combination will position me to lead the next generation of AI-powered privacy technology solutions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-i-will-succeed-in-the-program\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-i-will-succeed-in-the-program\"></a>Why I Will Succeed in the Program</h3>\n<p>My proven ability to create and adhere to rigorous learning schedules will ensure my success in UPenn's MS-AI program. For years, I have maintained a disciplined routine of studying from 6-8 am daily, cycling through topics like statistics, probability, music production, system design, and database engineering quarterly. This self-directed learning approach, combined with my professional experience, enabled me to advance to Principal Engineer at 32 despite a delayed career start.</p>\n<p>My professional background also positions me for success. As someone who leads production systems used by major enterprises, I understand the importance of delivering high-quality solutions within deadlines. This project management experience will be invaluable for balancing coursework with professional responsibilities. Additionally, my experience implementing AI solutions at Sourcepoint has provided practical context that will help me connect theoretical concepts to real-world applications more effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-i-will-contribute-to-the-mse-ai-online-community\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-i-will-contribute-to-the-mse-ai-online-community\"></a>How I Will Contribute to the MSE-AI Online Community</h3>\n<p>I plan to contribute to the MSE-AI community in several ways:</p>\n<p>First, I bring industry perspective from privacy technology, an area where AI applications are increasingly important but must navigate complex regulatory environments. I can share insights on the practical challenges of implementing AI solutions within highly regulated contexts, creating valuable discussion points for peers interested in ethical AI deployment.</p>\n<p>Second, my experience leading engineering teams positions me to contribute meaningfully to collaborative projects. I plan to actively participate in study groups, offering both technical expertise and project management skills to help teams deliver high-quality work efficiently.</p>\n<p>Third, I intend to document and share my journey applying program concepts to real-world problems at Sourcepoint. By creating case studies of how I implement course learnings in industry, I can help bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application for fellow students.</p>\n<h3 id=\"managing-the-time-commitment\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#managing-the-time-commitment\"></a>Managing the Time Commitment</h3>\n<p>I am fully prepared to dedicate the required 15+ hours per week per course to this program. My existing schedule already incorporates structured study time that I can expand and adapt. Specifically:</p>\n<p>My current daily routine includes 2 hours of professional development (6-8 am), which I will dedicate entirely to UPenn coursework. I also currently allocate an hour in the evening for additional studying, which I will extend to 2 hours. This provides 21 hours weekly dedicated to coursework.</p>\n<p>At Sourcepoint, I've already discussed this educational pursuit with leadership and secured their support, including flexibility for occasional daytime lectures or team activities that may overlap with work hours. I've also trained team members to handle routine responsibilities, creating additional bandwidth for my studies.</p>\n<p>I plan to optimize efficiency by aligning course projects with my professional work wherever possible, applying what I learn directly to Sourcepoint's AI initiatives. This creates a synergistic relationship between my studies and work rather than treating them as competing priorities.</p>\n<p>I feel it's important to address the early academic setbacks in my journey. Until 12th grade, I consistently topped every class I was in and achieved a 2350 on my SATs after just two weeks of studying. Growing up in an abusive family environment that severely restricted my freedom, the sudden independence I experienced in college led to poor coping mechanisms. I developed a severe marijuana addiction and eating disorder, which resulted in intestinal ulcers, anorexia, and poor academic performance. This academic failure was particularly difficult to accept given my previous record of excellence. It took me two years of dedicated effort to overcome the addiction and an additional year to heal my body—all while in a foreign country without any family support, which I consider a significant personal achievement. These challenges taught me invaluable lessons about perseverance and self-discipline, and failing early in life was a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>I believe my determination and discipline, evidenced by my rigorous self-improvement regimen and professional advancement despite these early academic setbacks, will serve me well in UPenn's program. My journey from struggling student to Principal Engineer demonstrates not only resilience but an ability to systematically acquire and apply new knowledge—qualities that will ensure my success in the MS-AI program and enable me to contribute meaningfully to the UPenn community.</p>\n<p>I look forward to the opportunity to grow as part of the UPenn community and contribute to advancing the intersection of privacy technology and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/dendron-main/notes/wazdc4ng17k2avtkt1t4w0t\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled class=\"task-before task-status\" checked>MSAI UPenn Application<span class=\"task-after task-priority\">priority:high</span><span class=\"task-after task-due\">due:2025.05.07</span><span class=\"task-after task-owner\">@Sid</span></a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","desc":"","updated":1746040151076,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"},"contentHash":"3338f3f44ea53fff248fd70b6ad85170","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["oz8e6a05bjgd3cbtru3hqe2","c1bs7wsjfbhb0zipaywqv1","3x4fmd16chquma6kovvfatj","gdjyzsq56qgyj5t5uktrsgu","69h59jt3vyfdg55g7gqc95d","wz9z8az9m9aq5132p7d10co","l1lcmphk4ubvu1aiqhcs7ib","bd3mupfj68nrgnjejss1qqh","1tlnuf6o2f3qawzg799ilzk","z5mfdumpr0cv3ceh60flq8n","filwymswyiwdojrwinvy5xd"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nSiddharth's root\n\nThis vault contains all the verticals to climb."},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableSmartRefs":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableMermaid":true},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal Knowledge Space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://sid1081.github.io","assetsPrefix":"/dendron-main","enableMermaid":true,"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
