<p>My name is Siddharth Sharma and I am 32 years old. I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and I am a Principal Engineer at a privacy-tech company in NYC - Sourcepoint Techologies Inc. I live in the hip neighborhood of Willamsburg Brooklyn, NY in a penthouse apartment that I bought in 2023. I have deep expertise in software engineering that I have gained over the years of building production applications from scratch that some of the biggest enterprises and publishers across the world leverage every second to make money off ads on the internet - BBC, WSJ, IBM, SKY, BILD to name a few. Before my time at Sourcepoint I built ETR's research tool from scratch that was leveraged by some of the biggest names on wall st to perform market research and sentiment analysis. This is how my parents or my wife's parents introduce me to new people. This is how society gauges your achievements and deems you worthy of their attention and company.</p>
<p>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't proud of some of these achievements, especially considering my horeendous time at college. Growing up in India, I was a grade A student, always in the 95th percentile, either topping my class or in the top 3. Like most Indian kids at that time, I wasn't really given an option to choose what I wanted to study or to pick my passion. I had a deep passion for learning in general but besides that, I was very fascinated by music(I am eastern clasically trained) and art. I left home at the the age of 17 to start my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. This was a very last min decision fueled from having an abusive grandmother and my parents decided that it would be best for me to leave the house. I studied for the SATs for about 2 weeks and got ~2350. I wasn't even aware of colleges like Stanford and MIT back then and only applied to UIUC because a friend of mine had just been admitted into their aerospace engineering program. I wasn't allowed to hang out with friends affter 8pm and I hadn't ever been to a sleep over in my life since my grandmother did not approve of that and cut to flying from Mumbai to Chicago and thats how it all began. My first semester at UIUC, I experienced freedom like never before and having been curtailed all my life, I abused that freedom wholeheartedly. The next 2 years I battled with severe marijuana addiction to the point that I didn't show up for lectures nor did I submit any assignments, I still scraped through the first few semesters still riding on my prowess from the Indian schooling that I had but that only took me so far. I was chucked out of college in 2013 and I transferred to Florida Institute of Technology. It took me one more year of failing and growing up to finally kick my marijuana addiction in the but. Starting early 2015 I got back to my older self and graduated with a computer science degree in Decemeber 2016 with a CGPA of 3.1 having taken 20 credits in the last semester. Since then, I have only looked to move onwards and forward. Failing early in life was a blessing in disguise which I thankfully came out stronger on the other side and it has definitely contributed to my determination, rigor and mindset in life. </p>
<p>Starting 2016 until 2022, I focused on being the best version of myself, whether it be working out, or taking courses, reading books, parpers or working on projects so I can be the best at whatever I do whether it be my fitness or software engineering. My daily routine looked something like this - Study from 6am to 8am, topics change every quarter, ranging from Statistics, Probability, Physics, Math, Machine Learning, Web Development, Typescript, Rust, System Design, Backend Engineering, Databases etc. I'd then go to the gym from 8AM to 9AM followed but two very intense 4 hour work sessions and then another hour long study session at night. This regime is definitely what got me through the ranks at ETR and Sourcepoint. As a principal engineer at the age of 32 despite have a delayed start to my career is a fairly impressive feat.</p>
<p>Early this year, I started to delve into Machine Learning beyong the typical developer experience of using Cline or Cursor to write unit and regression tests or performing code refactoring. I first took Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera and brushed up on topics like Linear and Logistic Regressions followed by Neural Networks. In the mean time, I also brushed up on my College Statistics by reading through OpenStax Statistics by Rice University. This course was my first real intro to Machine Learning and I was hooked. Upon completing this course I started to read more papers(Attention is all you need being one of the few) and learned about the newer machine learning architectures like Transformers, Attention blocks, Backpropagation and such while also keeping up with this fast paced industry with MCP servers, Agentic workflows...add some more stuff here... This deep dive helped me ideate the first AI/ML project at Sourcepoint(which I am currently leading)- leverage foundation models to generate consent_messages(just a proprietary format for representign HTML, CSS and JS). The main aim of this project is to significantly reduce the time and effort it takes our clients to setup consent messages by leveraging foundation models to take them from 0-80 in a matter of a few minutes. In order to work on this project, I had to learn a mix of prompt engineering along RAG methodologies to inject the relevant context into the Foundation models. The boom in AI has allowed sfotware engineers like me with limited ML knowledge to be able to build AI applications without actully developing/training/fine-tuning/evaluating the models myself. Its redcued the barrier for entry to the ML world by democratizing these models. While working with these models has been extremely beneficial us as a company, the more I work with these models, the more I wish that I had the foundation ML skills to build these models myself. While I am not particularly bullish about AI changing the world over night; I do believe that over time(literally since there is no upper limit on AI performance) it's going to be essential to know how to work with these models and this is one of the main reasons I have decided to pursue a Masters In ML/AI. I am tired of using managed blackboxes(Open AI API, Amazon Bedrock) to build applications that would have otherwise been seemless/easier to build using much smaller and simpler models that I could build myself if I had the chops. Write more about how ML Engineering is superlative to AI engineering here...</p>
<p>Considering that I will be working full time leading the engineering efforts at Sourcepoint, a part-time online degree is my only option. But I am fortunate that we live in a world where Ivy League institutions like UPenn offer such degrees. I have checked out the course catalog of a few universities like Georgia Tech, UT Austin and UIUC's but UPenn's program seems to have a lot of core courses like Principles of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artifical Intelligence, Computer Vision and GPU Computing for Machine Learning Systems will offer the perfect foundational knowledge that I will be able to leverage in the real world. ....they said the degree was geared towards a ML Ops role and it sounds like you have experience with the "Ops" side. Write in your SOP that you hope to leverage this degree into a seamless transition from infra to MLops and you should be fine.  .....Also write about learning GPU programming to write high performant and large scale machine learning systems l</p>
<p>...Write a conclusion here....</p>
<!-- In 2022, having achieved what I had been striving for - a high salary, deep expertise in backend engineering, and decent fitness levels, I realized that I still wasn't content and I started to look outside of work to find this feeling. All my life, I have been obsessed with music. Growing up, I spent years training in eastern classical music and my mother was also clasically trained and natually, I was surrounded by music at all times. Even through the college years, the one thing that was a constant in my life through all of the lows was - house/tech-house/techno music. On an average, I would listen to my favorite artists for at least 5-7 hours a day. I was obsessed with details in the tracks, how the hi-hats sounded so polished, how th snare fills were disperesed through the tracks, how strings were use to build tension, how fx helped with transitions and how dissonant chords and stabs sounded so in-key with the track. I started to make house music and I have attached a few of my favorite tracks that I don't hate(I struggle with liking my own music) in my portfolio. As I made more music, I started to feel more content and more at peace. I slowly started to realize that this is one of the things that brings me true joy, pleasure and peace. I'm not for a minute suggesting that every minute of making music is blisseverything is fun till it's just a hobby, in fact since 2024 when I started taking it more seriously, making music is just like any other task, you have your highs and your lows. Some days, that feeling of finally finding that one vocal sample that bring your track together or that one leading note in your chord progression that makes the bridge is very intoxicating, but there there are days where hours go by and nothing of substance comes out, twiddling with frequencies and notes for hours at end and a 4min elevator music track to show for it. But despite all of this, making music brings me great joy and pleasure something that is unparalleled and something that I have never felt with hours of coding and building some very complex systems.

Alright, now that I have set the stage and context I think it's time to convey why Architectre and how the above fits into this brief. I grew up in a beautiful apartment in Mumbai and my mother worked with an architect to build our apartment. Only now do I realize that it was through those years that I might have developed an eye for design, aesthetics and space (please replace with more architecture friendly words). EVen growing up, I was obsessed with finding websites that had good UX and I would configure my desktop and phone to take advantage of these beautiful apps so my digitial life was intuitively organized. This started to bleed into my personal projects as well and it can be seen in a tool that I developed years ago to consolidate all of my music from different sources like Spotify, Discogs, Bandcamp, Youtub and Soundcloud. In 2023 after buying my apartment, I decided to do the interiors myself. I first purchased a book called Studio Craft and Technique for Architects and I taught myself how to do perspective drawings, I have attached one in my portfolio. I then watched a few videos on how to use AutoCAD and modeled the entire upper floor of the apartment. I went through a few different iterations really trying to think through what the primary function of that space would be and I was able to problem solve my way through a plan for that space. Upon execution, that space which is my primary office, was a big success. I then translated that approach to the rest of the apartment, including the bedroom and the living room, details of which I have included in my portfolio. But as I worked through different iterations of the floor plans and the models, I realized that I was falling in love with this process. In the little experience that I have had with this work, I found the problem solving part of it to be extremely stimulating. It is similar to programming in that sense that you have various tools at your disposal to "solve" the problem, solving the problem is usually all about trade offs, about finding the right balance between form and function; similar to programming where you can optimize on speed or memory. I also found that unlike a lot of other topics that I have learned over the years, this came very naturally to me. I have since started going through the works of George Luss and Dieter Rams.....(fill in examples of work they have done here please) and in my free time, tend to watch videos about space, structures ... fill in some more architecture related stuff here showing that I am obsessed with it.

Around two years ago, I decided for myself that by 2025 I would have made at least 3 professional sounding tracks that I am proud of. This might sound like a benign goal but considering my refined taste in music and the fact that I am extremely harsh on my work, it was a tenable goal that I had to work really hard towards achieving. Two months ago, I decided that I want to learn the skills to be an architect. I want to be able to build structures, homes, entities. I have no financial motive behind this decision. I don't publish any of my music online or on social media. I make music for myself(and my wife) and because I love doing it. Not to say that I am opposed to playing my music to others, but that's not my primary goal. Similarly, I simply want to learn how to build structures and doing an online Masters at ASU is one of the very few ways working professionals like me can learn this skill. In theory, I could device a plan to get to where I want to without doing an MArch; but having a structured program to follow with guidance from the faculty at ASU will accelerate this process. What I have tried to highlight through the above paragraphs in the SOP is that 1. I have the courage and determination to drag myself out of adversity 2. I have the ability to learn from my failures and come out stronger 3. I have demonstarted the ability to pick up a new skill in music production much later in life and hone it to a semi-professional level 4. I am driven by my passions and I can go to any length to fulfill them. At 32, I feel like it's now or never for me to do this MArch degree and I would be remiss to not give it a real shot.

.... Please also include some notes about ASU in the SOP and mention that fact that I will be doing this degree part time while working full time and that my wife is on board with this.... -->
