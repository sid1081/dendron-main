## Morning

Today I want to mainly work on my MSAI application by finishing up the coursera course. I didn't sleep very well last night. It might make sense to change my sleeping pattern a little bit, maybe start waking up around 7am and shower immediately followed by tea and 30 mins of statistics.

## Dos

- [X] Workout
- [X] Objective Music Production
- [[task.MSAI UPenn Application]] 

### Gratitude

I am grateful for:

1. My salary
2. My wife
3. My drive

### What would make today great?

1. If I finished the coursera course
2. If I was able to do a 1000 skips in 30 mins
3. If my itching is better

### Daily affirmations

I am chill and happy.

## Evening

<!-- Fill out this section before going to sleep, reflecting on your day -->

### Amazing things that happened today

1. Finished the Advanced Machine Learning course.
2. Finished the SOP and MSAI Application

### How could I have made today even better?

I could have made today better by being more calm, and grateful about what I have in life.
